## Hi there üëã
# YouTube Bot Automation (n8n)

This is an `n8n` workflow that posts a comment on a specified YouTube video using the YouTube Data API.

## üöÄ What it Does

- Takes a YouTube video ID and comment text
- Sends a POST request to the YouTube API to comment on that video
- Uses OAuth2 credentials for secure authentication

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Import the workflow JSON into your `n8n` instance.
2. Add your own **OAuth2 YouTube API credentials** under `Credentials > OAuth2`.
3. Replace the values in the `Set` node:
   - `videoId` ‚Äì the ID of the YouTube video
   - `commentText` ‚Äì the comment to be posted
4. Run the workflow manually or on a trigger.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

- This workflow references an OAuth2 credential (`oAuth2Api`) that must be configured in your own n8n instance.
- No sensitive data (keys or tokens) are included in this file.

## üìÇ Files Included

- `YouTube-Bot Automation.json` ‚Äì the n8n workflow file

Feel free to modify or expand this workflow to support dynamic input, comment scheduling, or batch operations!
